problem:
> Three missionaries, three cannibals on one side of a river with a boat that can hold one or two
> people.  Get everyone to the other side of the river.  The number of missionaries in one place
> must be at least as high as the number of canibals in that place.

solve the problem optimally

representation:
> Let M represent the missionaries on the starting side of the river, M' represent the missionaries
> on the objective side of the river.  M and M' are 3-digit bit vectors where each bit represents
> the location of each missionary.  e.g. M=101 means the first and third missionary are on the
> starting side of the river and implies that M'=010 so the second missionary is on the objective
> side.
>
> Let C and C' be defined similarly for the cannibals.
>
> Let B=1 if the boat is on the starting side of the river, B=0 otherwise.  Similarly, let B'=1 if
> the boat is on the objective side and B'=0 if it is not.

goal state:
> M=000, M'=111, C=000, C'=111, B=0, B'=1.

starting state:
> M=111, M'=000, C=111, C'=000, B=1, B'=0.

actions:
> If B=1, then
>> Must set B=0 and B'=1, and also do one of:
>>> Move one bit from M to M'
>>> Move one bit from C to C'
>>> Move two bits from M to M'
>>> Move two bits from C to C'
>>> Move one bit from M to M' and one bit from C to C'
> Else If B'=1, then
>> Must set B=1 and B'=0, and also do one of:
>>> Move one bit from M' to M
>>> Move one bit from C' to C
>>> Move two bits from M' to M
>>> Move two bits from C' to C
>>> Move one bit from M' to M and one bit from C' to C

constraints:
> sum(M) >= sum(C)
> sum(M') >= sum(C')
