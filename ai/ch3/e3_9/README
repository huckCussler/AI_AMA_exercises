problem:
> Three missionaries, three cannibals on one side of a river with a boat that can hold one or two
> people.  Get everyone to the other side of the river.  The missionaries can never be outnumbered
> on either side of the river.

solve the problem optimally

representation:
> Let ms represent the missionaries on the starting side of the river, mg represent the missionaries
> on the goad side of the river.  ms and mg are integers in the range 0-3.
>
> Let cs and cg be defined similarly for the cannibals.
>
> Let bs=1 if the boat is on the starting side of the river, 0 otherwise.  Similarly, let bg=1 if
> the boat is on the objective side and 0 if it is not.

goal state:
> ms==0, mg==3, cs==0, cg==3, bs==0, bg==1.

starting state:
> ms==3, mg==0, cs==3, cg==0, bs==1, bg==1.

actions:
> If bs==1, then
>> set bs=0, bg=1 and do one of:
>>> ms-=1, mg+=1
>>> cs-=1, cg+=1
>>> ms-=2, mg+=2
>>> cs-=2, cg+=2
>>> ms-=1, mg+=1, cs-=1, cg+=1
> Else (bg==1), then
>> set bg=0, bs=1 and do one of:
>>> mg-=1, ms+=1
>>> cg-=1, cs+=1
>>> mg-=2, ms+=2
>>> cg-=2, cs+=2
>>> mg-=1, ms+=1, cg-=1, cs+=1

constraints:
> ms==0 OR ms>=cs
> mg==0 OR mg>=cg
